            Varanasi was the capital of the kingdom of Kashi during the time of the Buddha (6th century BCE),
            <br> who gave his first sermon nearby at Sarnath. The city remained a centre of religious, educational, and
            artistic activities as attested by <br> the celebrated Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang,
            who visited it in about 635 CE and said that the city extended for about 3 miles (5 km) along the western
            bank of the Ganges.

            Varanasi subsequently declined during three centuries of Muslim occupation, beginning in 1194.
            Many of the city’s Hindu temples were destroyed during the period of Muslim rule, and learned scholars fled
            to other parts of the country. <br>
            The Mughal emperor Akbar in the 16th century brought some relief to the city’s religious and cultural
            activities. There was another setback during the reign of the <br>
            Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the late 17th century, but later the Marathas sponsored a new revival. Varanasi
            became an independent kingdom in the 18th century, and under subsequent British rule
            it remained a commercial and religious centre.
